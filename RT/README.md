A raytracer project.

for quick use : ./RT <scene file> (for exemple : ./RT scenes/cornell_box_ppm.rt) and click the "render" button.
You can also just execute the software and build your own scenes.

This software has been made using GTK for user interface and CUDA for rendering, you will need both those tools installed in order to compile the software.
You will also need to have a Nvidia graphic card for it to work.
